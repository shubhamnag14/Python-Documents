This simplifies the CPython implementation by making the Object Model (including critical built-in types such as dict) implictly safe againsy concurreny access. Locking the entire interpreter makes it easier for the interpreter to be multi-threaded at the expense of much of the parallelism afforded by multi-processor machines.\n",

Each of the threads tries to pass the barrier by calling the wait() method and will block until all of the threads have made their wait() calls. At this point, the threads are released simultaneously.\n",

    "\n",
    "Create a barrier object for parties number of threads. An action, when provided, is a callable to be called by one of the threads when they are released. timeout is the default timeout value if none is specified for the wait() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **wait(timeout=None)**\n",
    "Pass the barrier. When all the threads party to the barrier have called this function, they are all released simultaneously. If a timeout is provided, it is used in preference to any that was supplied to the class constructor.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **abort()**\n",
    "Put the barrier into a broken state. This causes any active or future calls to wait() to fail with the BrokenBarrierError. Use this for example if one of the threads needs to abort, to avoid deadlocking the application.\n",
